# Horiseon-Refactor
These are the HTML and CSS changes that I made to complete challenge-01
   
    HTML

First I changed title in line 7 I 'making my tab name'

Then I added alt= after every img src to give meaning in lines 30,37,44,54,61,68.

Next I added a id attribute to make the link that was not working.  NOTE-I actually don't know how adding an id attribute made this link work-NOTE

Those were all the changes I made to the HTML.
    
    CSS CONDENCING

First I made a font-family: in the universal for the font that everything had. The only two without the universal font is the header and footer, which was the same.    NOTE-Didn't know how to combine the footer and header font family into one-NOTE

.benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost all had the same CSS so I merged them using commas

.benefit-lead h3, .benefit-cost h3, .benefit-brand h3 all had the same CSS so I merged them using commas

.benefit-lead img, .benefit-cost img ,.benefit-brand img all had the same CSS so I merged them using commas

.search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing all had the same CSS so I merged them using commas 

.search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img all had the same CSS so I merged them using commas 

.search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2, .social-media-marketing h2 all had the same CSS so I merged them using commas
